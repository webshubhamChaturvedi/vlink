                Hyper-local Shopping App Seeking to Combine Online Retail &
                Local Shopping
              </h1>
              <p>
                VLink helped an online electronics company create an app that
                can go a long way toward helping local and regional retailers
                thrive in an age where better prices often are a few clicks
                away. The platform makes it easy for the shopper and the store
                to have an online dialog that leads to a value-add for the
                customer. The idea is to empower the retailer to leverage what
                it has and the big national online chain doesnâ€™t have: Locality
                and flexibility.

                locality and build relationships with prospects and ongoing
                customers, and neutralize the price advantage enjoyed by online
                retailers.

                  VLink worked with a major electronics, gadgets & appliances
                  retailer, on an app that can help neutralize the price
                  advantage enjoyed by online retailers.

                  The goal is for brick-and-mortar stores to take advantage of
                  their locality and build relationships with prospects and
                  ongoing customers.

                  Creativity is the key. What can a retailer offer a customer to
                  make up for the premium they will pay? Some extra filters for
                  a coffee machine? A couple of reams of paper with a copier
                  purchase? Set up for a home gym?

                  People like to shop at stores. The mobile app, by letting the
                  store and customer negotiate these perks, makes it more likely
                  they will continue doing so.
